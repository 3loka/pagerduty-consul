# Webhook Tester

This is a simple application that demonstrates how to use webhooks. It has a backend built with Node.js and Express, and a frontend built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a MongoDB database to store issues.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webhook-tester.git
cd webhook-tester
npm install


You'll need to have MongoDB running locally. If you don't have MongoDB installed, you can follow the official installation instructions.

Next, start the application:
npm start
The application will be running at http://localhost:3000.
To test the application, you can use the frontend to register a webhook and simulate issues. You can use a service like webhook.site to receive the webhooks.
